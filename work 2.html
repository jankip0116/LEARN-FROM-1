    const employee = "janki";
    employee = 4; // will throw error showing that the employee is already been declared hence cannot be redeclared
    console.log(b); 
    {
        let b = 10; //into mordern js instead of var we use let .
        console.log(b);
    }
    /* let is more preferable as we have the option to redeclare the variable if we use let.
    Talking about constant once we declare constant it cannot be redeclared hence this is the basic difference between var, let and const */
